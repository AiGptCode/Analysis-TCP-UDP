# Cyber security System Analysis Tcp Udp

## Description
This project implements a cybersecurity system for detecting anomalies and intrusions in network traffic. It utilizes machine learning models, network monitoring tools, and intrusion detection systems to monitor and respond to security threats in real-time.

## Features
- Network anomaly detection using machine learning models
- Integration with Snort and Zeek for intrusion detection
- Automated response mechanisms for handling security threats
- Real-time monitoring and logging of network 

## Usage
1. Initialize the cybersecurity system:
   ```bash
   python atu.py
   ```
2. Monitor network traffic and detect anomalies:
   - The system will start detecting intrusions based on alerts and logs from Snort and Zeek.
   - Anomalies in network traffic will be detected using machine learning models.

## Configuration
- Modify the `config.py` file to customize settings such as model parameters and response actions.
- Ensure that the `send_alert()` function is configured to handle alerts appropriately.
